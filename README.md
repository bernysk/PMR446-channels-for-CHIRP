# PMR446-channels-for-CHIRP
Pre-configured settings for CHIRP reprogramming tool to tune a Baofeng UV-5R (and similiar) radios into PMR446 frequensies.

The 128 memory slots of the UV-5R are utilized for 8 PMR channels and 15 subchannels each.

## subchannels i.e. tone i.e. CTCSS 
If you are not familiar with PMR, here's some basic information about subchannels. 
Subchannels (e.g. 3-13) use the same frequency as the main channel (e.g. 3-0), but they add an unhearable tone (sine wave), which is makes it possible for the receiving end to filter out other subchannels. This way multiple parties can operate on same frequency simultaneously without hearing each other. If you use the main channel, then you hear every subchannel, but no other subchannel hears you. So, I would recommended to use subchannels.
